## 🎯✨ THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE (Like Magic Spells!) ✨🎯

### 🕐⏰ Changing Show Times (Super Duper Easy!) ⏰🕐
When you open the website file, use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) - this is like having a magical treasure hunt tool! 🔍🗺️

Then just change the time like you're fixing a silly typo! Easy as eating cake! 🍰

### 🎭🌟 Changing Stuff About Comedians! 🌟🎭

**🎪✨ LET'S DO AN EXAMPLE TOGETHER! ✨🎪**

**⌨️ Step 2:** Type "Ridwan Hussain" and press Enter (like calling his name! 📢)
**👀 Step 3:** You'll see something that looks like this (don't be scared! 😊):
```
<p class="comedian-origin">🇮🇳 London • Indian Heritage</p>
```
(Don't worry about the weird < > symbols - they're just the computer's way of wearing fancy jewelry! 💎✨)

**✏️ Step 4:** Just change "Indian Heritage" to "Sri Lankan Heritage"! (Like changing your shirt! 👕➡️👔)
```
<p class="comedian-origin">🇱🇰 London • Sri Lankan Heritage</p>
```
(You can also change the flag from 🇮🇳 to 🇱🇰 for Sri Lanka! Flag swapping is fun! 🚩➡️🚩)

**💾 Step 5:** Scroll down and click the green "Save" button! (Green means GO! 🟢)

**💥🎊 BOOM! You did it! You're a website wizard now! 🎊💥** 🧙‍♀️✨

### 🏴🌍 Fun With Flags! (It's Like Collecting Stickers!) 🌍🏴

## 🖼️ ADDING PICTURES (A Bit Tricky But You Can Do It!)

### Getting Your Picture Ready:
1. **Find a nice picture** on your computer
2. **Give it a simple name** like `sarah.jpg` (NO SPACES! Computers hate spaces in names!)
3. **Make sure it ends in .jpg** (that's the picture type!)

### Putting the Picture on GitHub:
1. **Go to the website place** (remember: https://github.com/robertenciu86-cmyk/robertenciu86-cmyk.github.io)
2. **Look for a button that says "Add file"** - click it!
3. **Click "Upload files"**
4. **Drag your picture from your computer** OR click "choose your files"
5. **Write a message** like "I added Sarah's picture!"
6. **Click the green button!**

### Making the Picture Show on the Website:
This part has computer code but don't be scared! Just copy this:
```html
<img src="sarah.jpg" alt="Picture of Sarah">
```
Change "sarah.jpg" to whatever you named your picture!

**🚨 BUT HONESTLY... Just ask the AI robot to help you with pictures! It's much easier!**

## 🎨 WEBSITE STRUCTURE (FOR AI ASSISTANTS)

This is a **single-page website** built with:
- **Framework**: Static HTML with inline CSS
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Domain**: Custom domain via Namecheap (londoncomedygroup.com)
- **Design**: Neon/Miami aesthetic with pink/purple gradients
- **Sections**: Hero, Shows, Comedians, Gallery, Contact
- **Images**: All stored in root directory as .jpg files

### Key Files:
- `index.html` - The ENTIRE website (all content and styling)
- `CNAME` - Domain configuration (DON'T CHANGE!)
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll config (DON'T CHANGE!)
- `*.jpg` - All image files

### Color Scheme:
```css
--miami-pink: #FF006E;
--neon-pink: #FF10F0;
--hot-pink: #FF69B4;
--electric-blue: #00D9FF;
--neon-purple: #B026FF;
--dark-bg: #0A0A0A;
```

## 🌐 DOMAIN NAME STUFF (DON'T TOUCH THIS! IT'S SCARY!)

### What's a Domain Name?
It's the www.londoncomedygroup.com thing that people type to find your website!

### ⚠️ SUPER IMPORTANT DOMAIN INFO:
- **Where you bought it:** Namecheap (it's like a shop for website names)
- **When you bought it:** September 4, 2025
- **When it expires:** September 4, 2026 (ONE YEAR!)
- **🚨 REMINDER:** Someone needs to pay to renew it before September 2026 or the website name will stop working!

### DNS Settings (DO NOT TOUCH THESE EVER!)
**What's DNS?** It's like the phone book that tells the internet where to find your website.

**Current Settings (DON'T CHANGE!):**
- A Records point to: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153
- CNAME for www points to: robertenciu86-cmyk.github.io

**🛑 SERIOUSLY, DON'T TOUCH THESE!** If you change them, the website will break and everyone will be sad! If someone tells you to change DNS settings, ask the AI robot for help (not Robert, he's just a Romanian comedian)!

### How to Check if Domain is Working:
1. Type www.londoncomedygroup.com in your browser
2. If you see the website = GOOD! ✅
3. If you see an error = BAD! Ask Claude or ChatGPT for help! ❌

### If You Need to Login to Namecheap:
1. **DON'T!** It's too complicated and you'll probably break something!
2. If you absolutely MUST:
   - Go to www.namecheap.com
   - Click "Sign In"
   - Username and password = Ask Robert (but he probably forgot them!)
3. **But seriously, you really don't need to touch this!**

---

## ⚠️ GOLDEN RULES (SUPER IMPORTANT!)

### Things You Should Do ✅
- **ALWAYS** ask Robert for passwords first (even though he might have forgotten them!)
- **ALWAYS** wait 10 minutes after making changes before panicking
- **ALWAYS** write a nice message when you save (like "Fixed Tuesday show time")
- **ALWAYS** double-check your spelling!
- **ALWAYS** ask the AI robot if you're confused!

### Things You Should NEVER Do ❌
- **NEVER** delete the file called "CNAME" (the website will die!)
- **NEVER** change the repository name (the website will get lost!)
- **NEVER** mess with DNS settings (the website will disappear!)
- **NEVER** share the passwords with strangers!
- **NEVER** put spaces in picture file names (computers will cry!)

---

## 🆘 OH NO! SOMETHING WENT WRONG!

### The Website Looks Broken! 😱
**Don't panic! Here's what to do:**
1. Take a deep breath! 
2. Go back to GitHub
3. Look for a clock icon ⏰ (it shows old versions)
4. Find a time when it worked (like yesterday)
5. Click "Revert" - this is like a time machine!
6. Everything will go back to normal!

### I Changed Something But Can't See It! 😕
**The website is probably just sleepy! Try this:**
1. Count to 600 (that's 10 minutes!)
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (this wakes up your browser!)
3. If still nothing, open an "Incognito Window" (it's like a fresh start!)
4. Still nothing? Ask Robert or the AI robot!

### The Website Name Stopped Working! 🚨
**This is serious! Ask the AI robot (Claude or ChatGPT) RIGHT NOW!**
- It might mean the domain expired
- Or someone changed the DNS (remember, we said don't touch it!)
- The AI robot will know what to do (Robert won't, he's just a Romanian comedian with the passwords!)
